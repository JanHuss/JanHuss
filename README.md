# About Me:
I am an **Audio Tools Programmer** with a decade of experience in music production and sound design. 
I hold a **Bachelor (Honours) of Arts in Music Production and Sound Engineering**, and have just completed
a **Bachelor (Honours) Degree in Computer Science** with a focus on **Computer Game Applications Development**. 
My academic background in music production and programming uniquely positions me to bridge the gap between coders, 
composers, and sound designers, ensuring seamless collaboration in the games industry.

I am also a co-founder of [Studio Catloaf](https://janhuss.github.io/posts/The-Founding-of-Studio-Catloaf/), where I 
have taken on the roles as a producer, audio programmer, sound designer, and composer.
